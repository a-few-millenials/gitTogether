# gitTogether
An API for Developers to meet and collaborate together

This project is being development and maintained by a group of Junior Developers wanting to expand their skills. We chose to use this stack because we wanted to challenge ourselves to create a RESTful API using a framework that doesn't handle all of the work behind the scenes.

## Description
This project is a RESTful API with a React.js front-end.

#### MVP
* Users will be able to create new accounts and login.
* Users can view and create posts
* Users can send, receive, and view messages
* Users can subscribe to other accounts to view their posts on their main page
